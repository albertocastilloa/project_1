# Project 1:

## Is Airbnb profitable business?
* To understand Airbnb business model better we've analyzed L.A. City market to find out:
* What would be the average night rate for a room/apartment in LA?
* What variables determine the price of the night rate in Airbnb? (Pendiente Alfonso)
* How big is LA Airbnb market?
* Which part of the city is more profitable?
* Are they changing their rates according to the month/season?
* Is price influenced by location or reviews?
